# Tetris_In_JAVA
An advanced tetris game wherein instead of rectangular shapes, we have triangle baseed shapes. The interface is configurable for senior citizens and people with visual defects. The user can choose the game speed as well as score multiplier. Also, in the middle of the game the player can change the shape by keeping the mouse within the falling shape by incurring a score penalty.
